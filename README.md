# HR Analytics Dashboard

I have created this Dashboard using [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover).

- First the data has been imported into tableau.
- Created the **Key Performance Indicators** like Employee count, Attrition count, Attrition rate, Active employees, Avg age of the employees by using the calculated field.
- Plotted the department wise attrition using the **pie chart**.
- Age wise employee count is plotted using **bar chart**.
- Used the **heatmap** for job satisfaction rating, and created the filter for the education type.
- Created the horizontal bar graph to identify the Education field wise attrition.
- Finally sidde by side doughnut charts was created to know the attrition percentage by each age group.
